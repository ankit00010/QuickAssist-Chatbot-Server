# WhatsApp Chatbot for Efficient Customer Support & Engagement🤖📱[In Progress]

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** WhatsApp-Chatbot  
**Version:** 1.0

The **WhatsApp-Chatbot** is an automated solution designed to provide customers with information related to a company, entirely through WhatsApp. In the first version, the chatbot interacts with a database to provide instant responses to frequently asked questions (FAQs). In the second version, AI will be integrated, making interactions smoother, more personalized, and more intelligent.

### Version 1: Database-Driven Operations 🗂️

In Version 1, the chatbot uses a database to store and retrieve information. It answers frequently asked questions, and admins can add new FAQs via an admin platform built with **Next.js** and **TypeScript**. Users interact with the chatbot through WhatsApp, receiving real-time responses.

### Version 2: AI-Powered Chatbot 🤖💬

In Version 2, the chatbot will be enhanced with **AI** capabilities. The AI model will be trained to handle complex interactions, making the chatbot smarter and capable of learning from each conversation. This version will offer more human-like conversations, improving customer engagement.

## Problem Solved 🚀

The **WhatsApp-Chatbot** solves the problem of customers needing to wait for human support to get information. By providing a chatbot that can answer questions automatically via WhatsApp, users can get the information they need instantly.
